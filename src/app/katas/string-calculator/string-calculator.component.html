  <h5>Complete the String calculator in the string calculator service:</h5>
  <p>
    Add(numberString: string): string
    <br />
    <br />
    Start by running 'ng test'<br />
    <strong>you will only need to be working in string-calculator.service.spec and string-calculator.service</strong><br />
    The method should take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and will
    return their sum. for example “” or “1” or “1,2” as inputs. (for an empty
    string it will return 0)

    <h5>Hints:</h5>
    <ul class="hints">
      <li>
        Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and
        two numbers
      </li>
      <li>
        Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force
        yourself to write tests you did not think about
      </li>
      <li>Remember to refactor after each passing test</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h5>Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers</h5>
  <p>
    Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
the following input is ok: “1\n2,3” (will equal 6)
<span class="why"> the following input is NOT ok: “1,\n” (not need to prove it - just clarifying)</span>
  </p>
  <h5>Support different delimiters</h5>
  <p>
    to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate
    line that looks like this: “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example
    “//;\n1;2” should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ . the
    first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported
  </p>
  <h5>Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception</h5>
  <p>
    “negatives not allowed” - and the negative that was passed. 
    if there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message.
  </p>
  <span class="warn">
    STOP HERE if you are a beginner. Continue if you can finish the steps so far
    in less than 30 minutes.
  </span>
  <ul>
    <li>Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001 = 2</li>
    <li>
      Delimiters can be of any length with the following format:
      “//[delimiter]\n” for example: “//[***]\n1***2***3” should return 6
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow multiple delimiters like this: “//[delim1][delim2]\n” for example
      “//[*][%]\n1*2%3” should return 6.
    </li>
    <li>
      make sure you can also handle multiple delimiters with length longer than
      one char
    </li>
  </ul>

<!-- <p>
    This classic kata guides you step by step through the implementation of a
    calculator that receives a String as input. It is a good exercise on
    refactoring and incremental implementation. It is also a good candidate for
    practicing TDD.
  </p>
  <h4>First step</h4>
  <p>
    Create a function add that takes a String and returns a String: <br />
    Add(numberString: string): string<br />
    * <br />
    The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers separated by comma, and returns their
    sum.<br />
    * <br />
    An empty string will return “0”.<br />
    * <br />
    Example of inputs: "", "1", "1.1,2.2".<br />
  </p>
  <h4>Many numbers</h4>
  <p>
    Allow the add method to handle an unknown number of arguments.
  </p>
  <h4>Newline as separator</h4>
  <p>
    Allow the add method to handle newlines as separators:<br />
    * <br />
    "1\n2,3" should return "6".<br />
    * <br />
    "175.2,\n35" is invalid and should return the message "Number expected but
    '\n' found at position 6."<br />
  </p>
  <h4>Missing number in last position</h4>
  <p>
    Don’t allow the input to end in a separator.<br />
    "1,3," is invalid and should return the message Number expected but EOF
    found.<br />
  </p>
  <h4>Custom separators</h4>
  <p>
    Allow the add method to handle a different delimiter. To change the
    delimiter, the beginning of the input will contain a separate line that
    looks like this:<br />
    //[delimiter]\n[numbers]<br />
    * <br />
    "//;\n1;2" should return "3"<br />
    * <br />
    "//|\n1|2|3" should return "6"<br />
    * <br />
    "//sep\n2sep3" should return "5"<br />
    * <br />
    "//|\n1|2,3" is invalid and should return the message "'|' expected but ','
    found at position 3."<br />
    <br /><br />

    All existing scenarios should work as before.
  </p>

  <h4>Negative numbers</h4>
  <p>
    Calling add with negative numbers will return the message "Negative not
    allowed : " listing all negative numbers that were in the list of
    numbers.<br />
    * <br />
    "-1,2" is invalid and should return the message "Negative not allowed :
    -1"<br />
    * <br />
    "2,-4,-5" is invalid and should return the message "Negative not allowed :
    -4, -5"<br />
  </p>
  <h4>Multiple errors</h4>
  <p>
    Calling add with multiple errors will return all error messages separated by
    newlines.<br />
    "-1,,2" is invalid and return the message "Negative not allowed : -1\nNumber
    expected but ',' found at position 3."<br />
  </p>

  <h4>Errors management</h4>
  <p>
    Introduce an internal add function returning a number instead of a String,
    and test many solutions for the error messages. - Exception - maybe and
    monad approch - POSIX return code with message managemement - tuple with
    error struct like in Go - etc.
  </p>
  <h4>Other operations</h4>
  <p>Write a function for multiply with same rules</p>
